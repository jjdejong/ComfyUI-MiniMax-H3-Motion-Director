# MiniMax H3 Motion Director User Guide

**English** | [简体中文](USER_GUIDE_zh.md)

This guide is for users operating **MiniMax H3 Motion Director** for the first time. It focuses on practical use: **what each control does, when to use it, and how to run T2V / I2V / FL2V / R2V / V2V / RV2V / Mixed workflows.**

> Red numbers in the annotated screenshots follow the recommended interaction order. Controls that do not apply to the selected task are normally hidden by the Director.

---

## 1. The shortest useful workflow

Almost every project follows the same pipeline:

```text
Generation mode → Output settings → Segments/assets → Prompt → Generate → Live Preview → Postprocess → Results → Save Video
```

For a first test, generate a 5–10 second T2V clip:

1. On **Generate**, select `T2V — Text to Video`.
2. Set aspect ratio, megapixels and FPS.
3. Add one Prompt Group, then enter its prompt and duration.
4. Execute the ComfyUI workflow.
5. Watch the active stage under **Live Preview**.
6. Once the content is worth keeping, enable **Postprocess**. This avoids spending upscale/refine time on clips you may reroll.
7. Open **Results → Final Result**, inspect the output and save the video.

---

## 2. Choosing one of the six standalone modes

| Mode | Main input | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| `T2V` | Prompt | The shot is created entirely from text |
| `I2V` | Prompt + start image | You already have a character/scene/composition image and want to animate it |
| `FL2V` | Prompt + First / Last Image | You need explicit control over the visual start, end, or both |
| `R2V` | Prompt + image/video/audio references | You need identity, scene, prop, motion, style or voice references |
| `V2V` | Source Video + Prompt | You want to preserve source motion/timing structure while regenerating visuals |
| `RV2V` | Source Video + Prompt + References | You need source motion plus identity/audio/other references |

If different shots in one project need different methods, use **Mixed Mode** instead of building separate Director nodes.

---

## 3. T2V: basic text-to-video

![Standalone T2V controls](images/tutorial/01-standalone-t2v.webp)

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Generation mode | Selects `T2V / I2V / FL2V / R2V / V2V / RV2V / mixed` |
| 2 | Output aspect/resolution | Selects the project aspect ratio such as 16:9 or 9:16 |
| 3 | Megapixels | Controls first-pass generation scale; the calculated size is shown beside it |
| 4 | FPS | Output frame rate; normally keep it consistent across the project |
| 5 | Export mode | Controls the output range/method for this run |
| 6 | Material Library | Opens persistent reusable assets |
| 7 | Add Prompt Group | Adds another standalone T2V segment |
| 8 | Selective Run | Marks generation candidates; valid caches are reused automatically |
| 9 | Duration | Target duration of the current Prompt Group |
| 10 | Delete | Deletes the current group |
| 11 | Prompt | MiniMax H3 prompt for this segment |
| 12 | Between-group control | Boundary/continuity operations; available actions depend on mode and global settings |

### Generate a 30-second T2V as three 10-second segments

1. Select `T2V`.
2. Press **Add Prompt Group** twice so there are three groups.
3. Set each group to 10 seconds.
4. Write a prompt for each segment. For a continuous scene, explicitly carry forward character, environment and action state in later prompts.
5. Set output aspect, megapixels and FPS.
6. Run the workflow.
7. If one segment is poor, enable **Selective Run**, select that segment, and run with **Export all**. The complete output is assembled from the regenerated segment plus the other validated caches. Use **Retake selected** when a fresh take is required even if a cache exists.

---

## 4. I2V: animate one image

Use I2V when you already have a character, scene or composition image.

1. Select `I2V`.
2. Upload **one start image** to the segment.
3. Write what should happen next. Do not waste the prompt repeating every visual fact that is already unambiguous in the image.
4. Set duration and generate.

Common uses include animating a character portrait, starting from a designed scene, adding camera motion to a product image, or continuing from a previous segment's last frame.

---

## 5. FL2V: control the first and/or last frame

FL2V is for explicit visual endpoints.

- First Image only: start from a specified frame.
- Last Image only: make the generation arrive at a specified ending.
- First + Last: constrain both ends and let the model create the transition.

Workflow:

1. Select `FL2V`.
2. Upload First Image, Last Image, or only the endpoint you need.
3. Use the prompt to describe the motion and camera change between the endpoints.
4. Generate and inspect the transition. Fixed endpoints do not guarantee that every intermediate motion will be identical across rerolls.

---

## 6. R2V: identity, scene, motion and audio references

![R2V controls](images/tutorial/02-r2v-assets.webp)

R2V is the most useful standalone mode for recurring characters. Each Assets Group can contain up to:

```text
Picture 1–9
Video 1–3
Audio 1–3
```

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | R2V mode | Switches to reference-based video generation |
| 2 | Add Assets Group | Adds another R2V segment/group |
| 3 | Output aspect | Sets project framing |
| 4 | Export mode | Selects output range/method |
| 5 | Common References | Adds project-level references shared by multiple groups |
| 6 | Material Library | Assigns persistent image/audio/video/prompt assets |
| 7 | Reference preview/upload | Uploads or previews the current group's references |
| 8 | Assets Group | The complete input scope for the current R2V segment |
| 9 | Reference Pictures | Character, scene, prop, etc.; up to 9 |
| 10 | Prompt | Describes action, camera, dialogue and how references are used |
| 11 | Duration | Current group duration |
| 12 | Delete | Deletes the current group |

### Example: one character across three shots

1. Enter `R2V`.
2. Put the character's portrait/full-body identity references in **Common References**.
3. Create three Assets Groups.
4. Add only shot-specific scene, motion or audio references to each local group.
5. Write each shot prompt.
6. Generate, then rerun only shots that need another pass.

---

## 7. Common References: share assets across standalone groups

![Common references](images/tutorial/04-common-references.webp)

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Reference Images | Project-level shared pictures, up to 9 |
| 2 | Reference Videos | Project-level shared reference videos, up to 3 |
| 3 | Reference Audio | Project-level shared reference audio, up to 3 |

Use **Common References** for assets needed by many segments: a recurring character, location, prop, motion reference or voice.

Use **local segment assets** for media needed only by one segment. At execution time, the Director combines common and local references into the effective reference sequence for that task.

Rule of thumb:

- Needed by many groups → Common References.
- Needed by one group → local assets.

---

## 8. Material Library: persistent reuse across projects

![Material Library](images/tutorial/05-material-library.webp)

The Material Library is different from Common References. Common References belong to the current project; the Library stores assets for reuse across shots and later projects.

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Images / Audio / Video / Prompt | Switches asset type |
| 2 | Apply To | Shows the current target Segment/Group |
| 3 | Categories | Filters characters, scenes, props, other, etc. |
| 4 | Search | Finds assets by title |
| 5 | Clear Current Page Selection | Clears selections on the visible page |
| 6 | Clear All Selection | Clears selections across all pages |
| 7 | Add Material | Stores a new asset in the Library |
| 8 | Material cards | Selects assets to assign |
| 9 | Allocation Preview | Previews where selected assets will be assigned |
| 10 | Apply | Writes the current selection into the target |
| 11 | Close | Closes the Library |
| 12 | X | Closes the dialog |

### Important Mixed Mode rule

The Library targets the **currently selected Segment** and only exposes media that are legal for that mode.

The actual Mixed `Source Video` must still be uploaded locally to that Segment. A Library video is a Reference Video; it does not replace the Mixed Source Video input.

---

## 9. Reference Audio and Original Audio Drive

![Reference audio and drive timeline](images/tutorial/06-reference-audio.webp)

Reference audio can have two roles:

- **Normal reference**: audio is provided as reference information to H3.
- **Original Audio Drive**: the original audio is placed at a specific time on the segment's Drive timeline and becomes part of the segment's timed audio-driving setup.

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Reference Video area | Adds reference videos |
| 2 | Video slots | Individual video reference slots |
| 3 | Reference Audio area | Current audio references |
| 4–5 | Audio cards | Play, edit and inspect each audio item |
| 6 | Audio Role | Switches Normal reference / Original Audio Drive |
| 7 | Empty Audio slot | Uploads another audio item |
| 8 | Drive timeline | Drag Audio Drive blocks to the time where they should occur |

Two direct Drive timeline constraints apply:

1. Drive intervals cannot overlap.
2. A Drive block cannot extend beyond the current Segment; move it earlier or trim it shorter.

### Audio editor

![Audio editor](images/tutorial/07-audio-editor.webp)

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Waveform | Shows the audio and lets you adjust the retained range |
| 2 | Trim start | Start time of the kept range |
| 3 | Trim end | End time of the kept range |
| 4 | Play | Previews the current selection |
| 5 | Undo | Undoes one edit |
| 6 | Redo | Redoes an edit |
| 7 | Reset | Restores the original trim range |
| 8 | Trim | Applies the current trim range |
| 9 | Cancel | Discards the current editor changes and closes the editor |
| 10 | Done | Saves the edit and returns to the Director |

`Effective` is a read-only duration display, so it does not receive a red operation number.

A typical dialogue workflow is: trim a long recording to the required line, then drag that block on the Drive timeline to the exact point where the line should occur.

---

## 10. V2V: preserve source motion, regenerate visuals

V2V uses `Source Video + Prompt`.

Typical uses:

- Keep the source performance/timing while changing clothes, environment or style.
- Use a live-action clip as a motion template.
- Regenerate a shot without designing movement from scratch.

Workflow:

1. Select `V2V`.
2. Upload Source Video.
3. Select the required Source Range.
4. State clearly what must change and what must remain.
5. Generate and inspect whether the motion structure is preserved well enough.

Standalone V2V/RV2V can also use the Director's **Source Bridge** around eligible source-video segment boundaries instead of treating every split as a simple hard cut.

---

## 11. RV2V: source motion plus identity/audio references

RV2V adds reference media on top of V2V's Source Video.

Example: replace the performer in a source clip with a character defined by reference images while preserving the source motion.

1. Select `RV2V`.
2. Upload Source Video.
3. Add Identity Pictures.
4. Add audio/reference media only when needed.
5. In the prompt, state the identity replacement and which source motion/camera properties must remain.
6. Generate.

Source Video provides motion/timing structure; Identity/Reference media provide character or other reference features. Treat them as separate input roles.

---

## 12. Mixed Mode: combine generation methods on one timeline

![Mixed Mode controls](images/tutorial/03-mixed-mode.webp)

Mixed Mode is the most practical choice for a complete project.

Example:

```text
S1  T2V
S2  I2V
S3  R2V
S4  Source Video
S5  T2V
```

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | `mixed` | Enters Mixed Mode |
| 2–5 | Output settings | Resolution mode, width, height and FPS |
| 6 | Export mode | Sets output behavior |
| 7 | Material Library | Assigns legal assets to the currently selected Segment |
| 8 | Add Segment | Adds another Segment |
| 9 | Selective Run | Marks generation candidates; valid caches are reused automatically |
| 10 | Segment timeline | Select, inspect, copy, delete and organize Segments |
| 11 | Boundary controls | Requests visual/generated-audio continuity between adjacent Segments |
| 12 | Selected Segment | Green outline shows which Segment is being edited |
| 13 | Generation mode | Per-Segment T2V / I2V / FL2V / R2V / Source Video |
| 14 | Duration | Segment duration; Source Video uses the selected Source Range |
| 15 | Prompt | Prompt for the selected Segment |

### Mixed Source Video rule

Mixed intentionally exposes one `Source Video` mode:

```text
Source Video + 0 Identity Pictures  → V2V
Source Video + Identity Pictures   → RV2V
```

`Start sec / End sec` define the Source Range and therefore the Segment duration.

### Segment Result

A later Segment can reuse a decoded static frame from an earlier completed Segment:

```text
Earlier Segment → last frame
Earlier Segment → explicit frame index
```

Typical uses:

- S1 last frame → S2 I2V start image.
- A frame from S2 → S3 FL2V First Image.
- Earlier result → later FL2V Last Image.

Segment Result references are **backward-only**: later Segments can use earlier results, not future Segments that do not exist yet.

### Boundary continuity

The controls between Segment cards decide whether that boundary requests visual and/or generated-audio continuity. Node-level continuity settings remain the global master switches.

Enable continuity for a continuing scene; reset a boundary when deliberately changing scene, identity or style.

---

## 13. Selective Run: reroll only the bad shot

The expensive mistake in a long project is rerunning every shot because one shot failed.

Recommended workflow:

1. Generate all segments once.
2. Identify the segments that are not good enough.
3. Enable **Selective Run**.
4. Select only those Segment/Groups.
5. Run normally: valid caches are reused, and only missing/stale candidates are generated.
6. Keep the other cached/source results in the final output with **Export all**.
7. Once the edit is locked, run final Global Refine / Face Refine.

This is also why a low-resolution first pass is efficient: spend upscale/refine time only on clips you have decided to keep.

---

## 14. Postprocess: Global Refine, Upscale and Face Refine

![Post-processing](images/tutorial/08-postprocess.webp)

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Postprocess page | Opens the post-processing pipeline |
| 2 | Global Refine master | Enables/disables the global refine pipeline |
| 3 | Secondary Sampling | Second H3 sampling pass; seed, denoise and steps are configurable |
| 4 | Upscale | Selects H3 Learned Latent or other available upscale paths |
| 5 | Output Resolution | Sets the postprocess target size |
| 6 | NVIDIA RTX Deblur | Optional RTX deblur; requires the corresponding NVIDIA runtime/hardware |
| 7 | Face Refine master | Enables face refinement |
| 8 | Detection | Face detector, confidence and target face |
| 9 | Refine | Face regeneration strength and canvas quality |
| 10 | Pasteback | Mask, blend and color matching controls |
| 11 | Advanced Settings | Less commonly changed parameters |

### Recommended production order

```text
Low-resolution first pass → Check content/motion/composition → Reroll failed segments → Lock the shots → Global Refine / Upscale → Face Refine → Final Result
```

Director caches each completed first-pass H3 AV latent. Enabling or adjusting Global Refine then reuses that Draft latent and skips first-pass sampling, provided the generation settings and segment inputs have not changed. Running the Director with post-processing disabled also reuses a matching Draft latent for a no-op finalize; change the generation seed or inputs to request a new take. A successful Global Refine latent is also retained as the input to a later Face Refine-only run. Runs completed before Draft caching was added need one new first-pass generation to create the reusable latent.

Global Refine `Steps = 0` means `max(8, round(first-pass steps × 0.4))`; an 8-step first pass therefore produces an 8-step second-sampling pass. Upscale itself has no diffusion steps when Second Sampling is disabled. Face Refine uses the first-pass step count for each tracked face crop/chunk.

If Global Refine fails, the completed first-pass result is retained. If Face Refine cannot find a usable face or the stage fails, the assembled result remains available instead of invalidating the whole pipeline.

---

## 15. Live Preview: see what the pipeline is doing

![Live Preview](images/tutorial/09-live-preview.webp)

| # | Area | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Live Preview page | Opens Director Live Preview |
| 2 | General / Global Refine / Face Refine | Switches the stage being observed |
| 3 | Preview | Shows intermediate frames for the active stage |
| 4 | Progress/status | Current Segment, stage, step and overall progress |
| 5 | Preview Settings | Preview frame count, FPS, max resolution, JPEG quality and refresh interval |

Live Preview is observational; it does not change the prompt or generation result. Preview resolution/FPS can be lower than final output to reduce overhead.

---

## 16. Results: inspect and save the final video

![Results](images/tutorial/10-results.webp)

| # | Control | What it does |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Results page | Opens Results |
| 2 | Segment / Multi Segment / Final Result | Switches between one segment, a continuous range and the complete result |
| 3 | Player / playback controls | Checks final video and audio |
| 4 | Save Video panel | Video export settings |
| 5 | Auto-save final result | Writes the final video automatically when the pipeline completes |
| 6 | Path | Output directory |
| 7 | Filename prefix | Prefix for the saved file |
| 8 | Format | Container/format; `auto` lets the Director choose |
| 9 | Encoder | Video encoder; `auto` uses automatic selection |
| 10 | Encoding mode | Encoding strategy |
| 11 | Save Video | Manually saves the current final result |
| 12 | Copy report | Copies the current Director Report to the clipboard |

**Final Result Information** and the **Report body** are read-only information areas. Red callout `12` points to the operable Copy button. The report records the actual execution configuration, continuity, sampling and postprocess status.

The three result levels are:

- **Segment** — inspect one generated segment.
- **Multi Segment** — preview/export a continuous segment range.
- **Final Result** — inspect and save the complete pipeline output.

## 17. Common workflows you can follow directly

### A. Three continuous text-generated shots

```text
T2V
→ Add Prompt Group × 3
→ Prompt + Duration for each group
→ Enable required cross-segment continuity
→ Generate
→ Inspect each segment
→ Selective Run failed segments
→ Postprocess
→ Final Result
```

### B. Animate a character image

```text
I2V
→ Upload start image
→ Prompt for action/camera
→ Set Duration
→ Generate
```

### C. Force a shot to move from image A to image B

```text
FL2V
→ First Image = A
→ Last Image = B
→ Prompt describes the transition
→ Generate
```

### D. Same character across many shots

```text
R2V
→ Character references in Common References
→ One Assets Group per shot
→ Shot-specific scene/motion/audio in local assets
→ Prompt per group
→ Generate
```

### E. Keep source motion but regenerate the visuals

```text
V2V
→ Upload Source Video
→ Select Source Range
→ Prompt says what changes and what stays
→ Generate
```

### F. Replace the source performer with a referenced character

```text
RV2V
→ Source Video
→ Identity Pictures
→ Optional Reference / Drive Audio
→ Prompt: identity replacement + preserve source motion
→ Generate
```

### G. Five shots using different methods

```text
Mixed
→ Add Segment × 5
→ S1 T2V
→ S2 I2V
→ S3 R2V
→ S4 Source Video
→ S5 FL2V
→ Set visual/audio continuity at each boundary
→ Generate
→ Selective Run only failed shots
```

### H. Place recorded dialogue at an exact time

```text
R2V / RV2V
→ Upload Audio
→ Audio Role = Original Audio Drive
→ Edit Audio to the required range
→ Drag it to the correct time on Drive timeline
→ Verify no overlap and no segment overrun
→ Generate
```

## 18. Concepts that are easy to confuse

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Common References | References shared by multiple segments in the current project |
| Segment/Group Local Assets | Assets used only by the current segment |
| Material Library | Persistent assets reusable across projects |
| Source Video | Motion/timing structure for V2V/RV2V |
| Reference Video | Reference information; not the same role as Source Video |
| Segment Result | Static decoded frame from an earlier segment for later I2V/FL2V |
| Motion Context | Cross-segment motion/context continuity; separate from Segment Result |
| Selective Run | Selects generation candidates while keeping valid cached results |
| Global Refine | Global second-pass sampling/upscale after first-pass generation |
| Face Refine | Local H3 refinement on detected face regions followed by pasteback |

---

## 19. Pre-run checklist

Before a long generation, verify:

- The correct generation mode is selected.
- Aspect ratio, megapixels and FPS match the project.
- Duration / Source Range is correct for every segment.
- I2V / FL2V images are assigned to the correct endpoint.
- V2V / RV2V uses an actual Source Video, not merely a Reference Video.
- Common and local R2V/RV2V assets are assigned correctly.
- Audio Drive intervals do not overlap or exceed the segment.
- Mixed boundary continuity matches the story intent.
- Selective Run has not accidentally selected or omitted a segment.
- Expensive upscale/Face Refine is postponed until first-pass content is worth keeping.

That check prevents the most common avoidable reruns in long projects.
